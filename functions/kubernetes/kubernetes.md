## How to deploy Shuffle on Kubernetes?

### Prerequisites:
-	Clone the https://github.com/shuffle/Shuffle repository using Git and change the branch to main then navigate to the functions/kubernetes directory, which contains all the necessary Kubernetes configuration files for deployment.
-	Running Kubernetes cluster.
- Ensure you have a local Docker registry set up to store and manage Docker images for applications built using Shuffle. While the registry is crucial for handling custom-built apps, youâ€™ll still be able to run workflows without it. To setup a docker registry, if you have docker installed on one of your node run following commands.
  ```
  openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout certs/reg.key -x509 -days 365 -out certs/reg.crt -subj "/CN=<YOUR_NODE_LOCAL_IP>"
  docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name shuffle-local-registry \
  -v $(pwd)/certs:/certs \
  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/certs/reg.crt \
  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/certs/reg.key \
  registry:2
  ```
  - If you've used the above commands to set up a registry, you'll need to skip an SSL verification for your registry. If you're using Containerd as a runtime
    add the following lines in /etc/containerd/config.toml
    ```
    [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.mirrors."<REGISTRY_NODE_IP:PORT>"]
      endpoint = ["https://<REGISTRY_NODE_IP:PORT>"]

    [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.configs."<REGISTRY_NODE_IP:PORT>".tls]
      insecure_skip_verify = true

    ```
Step 1: Create a namespace called shuffle in a cluster by running ```kubectl create ns shuffle```.  

Step 2: Open the all-in-one.yaml file and review the configuration values. Change the value of REGISTRY_URL with '<NODE_IP>:5000' where the registry is at. Adjust other variables as per your deployment requirements; otherwise, the application will deploy using the default settings provided within the file. Then apply the deployment with `kubectl apply -f all-in-one.yaml -n shuffle`.  


Now, open ```https://<YOUR_NODE_IP>:30008``` or ```http://<YOUR_NODE_IP>:30007```. You should be seeing a signup page. NODE_IP should be where the frontend is deployed.
